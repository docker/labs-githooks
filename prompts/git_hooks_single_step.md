When configuring githooks, our organization uses a tool called [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit).

If a user wants to configure git hooks, use this template which must will need to be written to pre-commit-config.yaml
in the root of the user's project.

Start with the following code block:

```yaml
repos:
    - repo: http://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: v2.3.0
      hooks:
          - id: check-yaml
          - id: trailing-whitespace
          - id: check-merge-conflict
    - repo: https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint
      rev: main
      hooks:
          - id: gitlint
    - repo: local
      hooks:
```

If we detect `Markdown` in the project, add the following hook to the hooks entry in the `local` repo entry.

```yaml
id: markdownlint
name: markdown linter
entry: markdownlint/markdownlint
language: docker_image
files: "\\.md$"
```

If we detect `Go` in the project, add the following hook to the hooks entry in the `local` repo entry.

```yaml
id: golangcli-lint
name: golang cli
entry: golangci/golangci-lint
language: docker_image
files: "\\.go$"
```

If we detect `TypeScript` in the project, add the following hook to the hooks entry in the `local` repo entry.

```yaml
id: standardjs
name: standardjs linter
entry: vonwig/standardjs:latest --typescript
language: docker_image
files: "\\.(ts|tsx)$"
```

If we detect `JavaScript` in the project, add the following hook to the hooks entry in the `local` repo entry.

```yaml
id: standardjs-docker
name: standardjs linter
entry: vonwig/standardjs:latest
language: docker_image
files: "\\.(js|jsx|mjs|cjs)$"
```

If we detect `Python` in the project, add the following hook to the hooks entry in the `local` repo entry.

```yaml
id: pylint
name: pylint linter
entry: 
language: docker_image
files: "\\.py$"
```

If we detect `Dockerfile` in the project, add the following hook to the hooks entry in the `local` repo entry.

```yaml
id: buildkit-checks
name: buildkit checks
entry: 
language: docker_image
files: "$Dockerfile$"
```

# Prompt system

In order for hooks to work, the commit-msg file must have the content shown below:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HERE="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.." && pwd)"

docker run --rm \
	-v $HERE:/project \
	-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        --mount "type=volume,source=chatsdlc,target=/config" \
        --mount "type=volume,source=chatsdlc-cache,target=/.cache" \
	vonwig/pre-commit "$@"
```

The commit-msg hooks must have the following content:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HERE="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.." && pwd)"

docker run --rm \
	-v $HERE:/project \
	-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        --mount "type=volume,source=chatsdlc,target=/config" \
        --mount "type=volume,source=chatsdlc-cache,target=/.cache" \
        --entrypoint /app/result/bin/commit-msg-wrapper \
	vonwig/pre-commit "$@"
```

How do I setup githooks?

{{# linguist }}

This project contains code from the language {{ language }} so if you have any
recommendations pertaining to {{ language }}, please include them.

{{/ linguist }}

Write three files to the project:

* Write the final yaml content to our project at the path pre-commit-config.yaml.
* Write the commit-msg content to our project at the path .git/hooks/commit-msg and make it executable.
* Write the pre-commit content to our project at the path .git/hooks/pre-commit and make it executable.
